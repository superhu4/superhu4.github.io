    <h1>An Apologetic for Chinese Heritage Churches</h1>
    <p><em>By Steven Siu</em></p>
<h2 id="dedication">Dedication</h2>
<p>On May 14-16th, 2019, twenty-five English-speaking pastors from the
United States, Canada, and England gathered together for the first
Chinese Heritage Church Colloquium to share about, discuss, and envision
the ways in which God uses Chinese heritage churches(1) to advance his
kingdom. This paper was written with the help of these pastors,
represents some of the best thoughts from this conference, and is
dedicated to God, our churches, and fellow Chinese heritage church
pastors, who often labor unnoticed in a challenging harvest field. Our
prayer is that this paper brings encouragement, inspiration, and hope
for the future, to God’s glory.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Over the last two decades, the movement among evangelical churches in
the United States to become more multiethnic has grown. According to
Dr. Michael Emerson of Baylor University, the number of evangelical
multiethnic churches, where the congregation is composed of at least 20%
ethnic minorities within a multiethnic context, increased from 7% in
1998 to 23% in 2019, and the percentage of Asian American Christians
attending multiethnic churches in the United States also increased from
6% to 8% during this same time period.(2)</p>
<p>In light of this movement towards multiethnic churches, some have
argued that English- speaking Chinese American Christians should attend
multiethnic churches and that Chinese heritage churches are only for
those who speak Chinese. All churches should try to fulfill on earth the
heavenly vision of a multiethnic gathering of God’s people in
heaven.</p>
<p>God is the Lord of the Harvest. He establishes every church; he
establishes both multiethnic churches and Chinese heritage churches to
reach his harvest field. This paper is not an argument against
multiethnic churches, but an apologetic for Chinese heritage churches,
which are often misunderstood. It is our belief that Chinese heritage
churches are not just for first generation(3) Chinese immigrants but
play an important role in contributing to the beauty of the body of
Christ. In this paper, we will explore how God continues to use Chinese
heritage churches to fulfill his purposes to further his kingdom, and
we’ll also explore the potential future of Chinese heritage
churches.</p>
<h2 id="missional">Missional</h2>
<p>Chinese heritage churches are missional. God uses Chinese heritage
churches for missional purposes to fulfill the Great Commission through
diaspora missions. Dr. Enoch Wan defines diaspora missions as Christian
participation in God’s mission to evangelize their kinsmen on the move,
and through them to reach out to natives in their homeland and
beyond.(4) This diaspora missional calling is reflected in Paul’s
writings. In Romans 1:14, Paul writes about his obligation to reach both
the Jews and Gentiles, and in Romans 9:3, Paul writes about his deep
longing to reach his fellow Jew and his willingness to suffer on their
behalf so that they might be saved. Throughout Paul’s missionary
journeys, he often shared the gospel first with the Jews, a diaspora
people clustered in cities throughout Asia Minor and Greece, and then
with the Gentiles. Paul practiced diaspora missions.</p>
<p>Paul’s background as a diaspora Jew prepared him to practice diaspora
missions. He grew up as a Hellenistic Jew in Tarsus in Asia Minor. In
Acts 21:37, Paul spoke Greek, and in Acts 16:37, he was familiar with
Roman law and customs. In Acts 22:3, Paul also trained in Jerusalem
under Gamaliel as a Pharisee and was familiar with Jewish laws and
customs. He was equipped to minister to both Jews and Gentiles. In Acts
11:25, Barnabas, who was also a Hellenistic Jew, brought Paul to help
him in his work among the Hellenistic Jews and Gentiles at Antioch. Paul
was the best equipped of the Apostles to reach the Gentiles and became
the Apostle to the Gentiles, yet he shared the gospel to his kinsmen,
the Jews first. Paul practiced diaspora missions in reaching his own
people, the Jews first, before reaching the Gentiles.</p>
<p>Likewise, Chinese heritage churches have been practicing diaspora
missions by reaching the Chinese in America first. Per a 2012 Pew
Research study, 22 percent of the Chinese in America are Protestants,(5)
which may be up to 5 times greater than the percentage of Christians in
China.(6) Many if not most multiethnic and majority culture churches in
America are not equipped to minister to Mandarin-speaking or
Cantonese-speaking individuals. As a result, the vast majority of
conversions of first generation Chinese in America happen through
Chinese heritage churches practicing diaspora missions. In addition, the
vast majority of conversions of the second generation children of
Christian Chinese immigrants also happen in Chinese heritage churches
through diaspora missions. At many Chinese heritage churches, it is the
English- speaking adults, many of whom are second generation Chinese,
who evangelize and disciple the second and third generation children,
youth and college students; they sow and harvest doing the work of
diaspora missions without knowing it.</p>
<p>Engaging in diaspora missions is also reaching beyond your ethnic
group. The English-speaking congregations of many Chinese heritage
churches can reach beyond their own kinsmen to other diaspora and
majority culture people. This cross-cultural work reflects God’s
heartbeat. In Genesis 18:18, God blessed Abraham and his descendants so
that they would be a blessing to the nations. My church is predominantly
of Chinese ethnicity, but we have also reached out to other ethnic
groups and included them. We have Mexican, Vietnamese, and Irish
Americans attending my church and participating in leadership.</p>
<p>As a result of practicing diaspora missions, Chinese heritage
churches are uniquely positioned in their mission to reach first,
second, and third generation Chinese Americans and also non- Chinese,
who are receptive to their mission. Dr. Andrew Lee of the Global
Diaspora Institute noted, “The world is coming to our doorsteps as
Diaspora Missions is a hot area right now in Christianity. There is a
mass movement of people around the world and America will be one prime
destination place for refugees if immigration doors are re-opened under
the current administration. So that means more heritage churches and
second generational ministries in the years to come if this holds
true.”</p>
<h2 id="intergenerational">Intergenerational</h2>
<p>Chinese heritage churches are intergenerational, and God uses Chinese
heritage churches to foster intergenerational relationships,
discipleship, and evangelism within the church, which produces strong
Christian families. In Ephesians 2:19, through Christ, we are no longer
strangers but we are now members of God’s household. The church is a
family. This sense of family is also important in the Chinese culture
where adults are addressed as uncles and aunties by the youth and
children, and the elderly are addressed as grandpas and grandmas. When
these family relationships are also seen within the Chinese heritage
church, church feels like home or one large extended family. Several
years ago, my church surveyed our people asking them about what they
enjoyed most about the church. The number one answer across all age
groups and languages was that our people loved that the church was a
family church. The spiritual relationships in the context of family
mattered. I think this answer is echoed in many Chinese heritage
churches.</p>
<p>In addition, a sense of shared values, culture, and background allows
for individuals across age groups to serve together. There is an
inherent base of trust due to familiarity. In Acts 18, Priscilla and
Aquila quickly became effective co-workers with and companions of Paul.
They were Hellenistic Jews in Asia Minor like Paul, and they also shared
the same profession of tent making. Their shared backgrounds made it
easier for them to serve together. Similarly, the shared values of
family and Christian values in a Chinese heritage church help bring
different generations to serve together and use their spiritual gifts.
For instance, college students, young adults, and older adults may all
be drawn to serve together as advisors in the youth ministry. People of
all ages may enjoy serving together in missions, on various committees,
in choirs/worship teams, in the children’s ministry, in worship
services, or in planning special events for the church. There is a
beauty to seeing different generations serve together especially in the
United States where people are often segregated by age at church.</p>
<p>Importantly, because many Chinese heritage churches have ministries
across generations and languages, these churches can evangelize an
entire family unit. In my church, I’ve seen a Christian grandmother, who
attends the Cantonese service, invite her adult believing daughter and
non-believing son-in-law to the English service. They in turn bring
their daughter to the children’s program. I’ve also seen adults who
attend the English service invite their non- believing parents to
Cantonese and Mandarin services where some eventually become Christians.
The entire family can be evangelized in ways that leverage language and
culture.</p>
<h2 id="educational">Educational</h2>
<p>Chinese heritage churches are educational. God uses Chinese heritage
churches as instruments to grow his people’s Biblical and theological
understanding in hopes that they will live a life more pleasing to God.
Chinese people, who are heavily influenced by Confucianism, value
education. Not surprisingly, Chinese heritage churches tend to place a
high value on teaching the word of God and transformation through the
word, because they believe that God’s word is God breathed and useful
for teaching, rebuking, correcting, and training in righteousness (2
Timothy 3:16).</p>
<p>Many Chinese heritage churches focus on the importance of a proper
Biblical understanding. Expository preaching is often the primary method
of preaching. Pastors are encouraged to be faithful to God’s word and to
exegete properly. Topical messages tend to be secondary to expository
preaching. Like my church, many Chinese heritage churches may spend much
of the year covering books from the Old Testament, the gospels, and the
epistles in the hopes that our people gain an understanding of and
appreciation for God’s work of redemption in all of Scripture.</p>
<p>Many Chinese heritage churches also focus on the importance of a
proper theological understanding. There is a high view of God where God
is the all sufficient, holy, omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent
creator and redeemer of the universe. Human beings, in contrast, are
limited, idolatrous, and depraved. God in his amazing grace saved us
through the atoning work of Jesus Christ. The goal of greater
theological understanding is not knowledge that puffs up, but a renewal
of mind and heart to live a life of worship to God because of who he is
and what he has done to save us. Like many Chinese heritage churches, my
church has an appreciation for the works of those who have a high view
of God.</p>
<p>Because of this high value on Biblical and theological education,
Chinese heritage churches tend to call pastors, including youth pastors,
with a Master of Divinity degree from a seminary.</p>
<p>Some of these pastors have even returned to seminary to pursue a
Doctor of Ministry degree so that they can better equip their churches.
I am thankful that God uses Chinese heritage churches to help his people
know him and be transformed by his word.</p>
<h2 id="multicultural">Multicultural</h2>
<p>Chinese heritage churches are multicultural, and God uses Chinese
heritage churches to help develop inclusive, multicultural models of
ministry. Chinese heritage churches are surprisingly complex; they may
not be multiethnic, but they are multicultural and multilingual. In many
Chinese heritage churches, there may be Cantonese-speaking believers
raised in the culture of Hong Kong or Vietnam, Mandarin-speaking
believers raised in the culture of Taiwan or China, and English-speaking
believers raised in the mainstream culture of their countries and/or the
Chinese cultures of their families, amongst other cultures. What is
seemingly a monolithic ethnic church is a culturally and linguistically
diverse church. In this sense, Chinese heritage churches are
multicultural in their own way that is different than a majority culture
church’s idea of being multicultural.</p>
<p>Chinese heritage churches are similar to the Church of Jerusalem
which was also mono-ethnic but multicultural and multilingual. The
church was composed of Hebraic Jews, who were more culturally Jewish and
primarily spoke Aramaic, and Hellenistic Jews, who were more culturally
Greek and spoke Greek as well as the language of their country of
origin. Members of both of these groups were saved on Pentecost in Acts
2:8-12.</p>
<p>The Church of Jerusalem had to develop a new inclusive model of
ministry to more effectively minister to the Hellenistic Jews. In Acts
6, the inequitable distribution of food to Hellenistic Jewish widows
highlighted this deficiency. Hellenistic Jews did not receive the same
resources as Hebraic Jews, and there were no positions of leadership
available to them to be a voice for the Hellenistic Jews. In response,
the apostles, who were Hebraic Jews, asked the church to choose
individuals to lead the food distribution effort, and the people chose
seven Hellenistic Jews. The twelve apostles continued to teach and pray,
and the seven Hellenistic Jews oversaw the distribution of food. As a
result of the decision, the entire church was pleased. The unity seen in
Hellenistic and Hebraic Jews leading the church together and sharing
resources was beautiful not only to the church but to the world. More
people became disciples of Christ and a number of priests, who were
Hellenistic Jews, became Christians.</p>
<p>Similarly, Chinese heritage churches have had to develop new
inclusive models of ministry over time to more effectively reach and
minister to the Chinese population and beyond. Starting in 1853,
American denominations started planting the first Chinese heritage
churches as missions churches in Chinatowns; most of these churches were
pastored by former American missionaries to China, and by the 1950’s,
they were pastored primarily by Chinese ministers.(7) Some of these
churches changed their main service to a bilingual service to meet the
growing needs of their English-speaking children. Others added an
English-speaking service because their English-speaking children found
translated services unbearable. In the late 1950’s, overseas born
Chinese started planting Chinese heritage churches.(8) Like the
Chinatown churches, a number of these churches later added
English-speaking services to meet the needs of their English-speaking
children or adults. As these churches grew, one recurrent struggle was
whether to invite English-speaking adults into their executive
leadership. A number did not, which made it difficult for the American
born Chinese to have a voice in the direction of these churches. Other
Chinese heritage churches made the decision to include American born
Chinese into their executive leadership by making English the spoken
language at their elder council, deacon board, or executive meetings.
They also allocated equal resources to grow their English-speaking
congregations just as they would their Chinese congregations. This
willingness to share the executive leadership and resources with the
English-speaking is one common trait in most of the Chinese heritage
churches with large English congregations, and it has been used by God
to raise up many Chinese Christian leaders and co-workers. This desire
to develop an inclusive model of ministry makes multicultural and
multilingual Chinese heritage churches beautiful.</p>
<h2 id="home">Home</h2>
<p>Chinese heritage churches are home, a place of belonging and
acceptance for Chinese American Christians. According to a Pew Research
study on racial and ethnic composition of evangelical churches, 94% of
those who attend evangelical churches identify as Caucasian.(9)
Multiethnic evangelical churches are slightly better. In 2019, 23% of
evangelical churches could claim that their congregation was multiethnic
with at least 20% of racial/ethnic groups aside from Caucasian.(10) The
vast majority of evangelical churches in America are majority culture
dominated. Without knowing it, the issues that are discussed and the
values that are espoused are those that the majority culture cares
about. As a result, Dr. Michael Emerson writes that sometimes people of
color in these churches start to feel, “Do we really matter? Do we
really belong?”(11) Chinese heritage churches provide a home where the
culture, values and people of Chinese American Christian communities are
celebrated and accepted.</p>
<p>Chinese heritage churches provide space for Chinese Americans
Christians to follow Christ in culturally appropriate ways. In Romans 14
and 1 Corinthians 8, the Roman and Corinthian churches struggled with
what types of behaviors or foods were acceptable due to the cultural
sensitivities of Jews and Gentiles. Oftentimes when Chinese Americans
attend majority culture or multiethnic churches, they are forced to
accept majority culture values. Erin Ding writes, “Recent research has
supported the notion that large, multiracial churches with largely white
pastoral leadership can unintentionally pressure worshipers to conform
to culturally white behaviors.”(12) In order to reduce conflict in
multiethnic churches, churches tend to choose what works for the
majority. Korie Edwards shares from her experience as an ethnic minority
in a majority culture church, “Because people who are ethnically similar
share similar ideas of how church should look: the length of worship
services, the music sung, the preaching style, the appropriate clothing,
the languages spoken, and the food served … Without this commonality,
more conflict arises, and those with more power set church culture and
structure.”(13) Chinese heritage churches provide an alternate
environment that may satisfy the cultural preferences of first, second,
and third generation immigrant believers. Ding writes, “As they [the
second and third generation children of immigrants] raise their own
children, many are pondering the type of faith and cultural environment
they want to bestow on their kids. That often means a search for
churches that will incorporate their stories, embrace their heritage,
and hire leaders who look like them.”(14)</p>
<p>Chinese heritage churches foster belonging by espousing the values of
Chinese American Christians. During the COVID19 pandemic, a number of
new families and individuals joined my church. When I asked them why
they chose to worship at my church, I was surprised at their response. A
number responded that they appreciated our church for taking COVID19
seriously and for requiring those attending the indoor service to wear
masks. They no longer felt safe worshiping at majority culture churches,
and they felt looked down upon when they wore their masks. Like many
Chinese American Christians, my church values the opinions of our
medical professionals. One of our elders, who is an infectious disease
doctor, encouraged us to maintain masks indoors until the infection rate
dropped. This value on safety helped our newcomers feel comfortable
worshiping with us, and they felt a sense of belonging because everyone
shared the same values. In addition, over the years, my church has had
an inflow of Chinese American Christian youths from majority culture
churches. Although the parents of the youths felt comfort in majority
culture churches, the youths were not comfortable. A number of these
youths mentioned to me that if they aspired to attend a good college,
they were often seen as overachievers and felt like misfits in majority
culture churches. These majority culture “misfits” found a safe home in
my church where it is normative to pursue Christ and education. There
was also a greater sense of acceptance in the group due to shared
communication styles, family values, and background. The body of Christ
needs churches that celebrate values that majority culture churches may
not.</p>
<p>Chinese heritage churches are one of the few church settings where
Chinese American Christians are encouraged to lead at the highest level.
The Harvard Business Review reported that Asian Americans were the least
likely group to be promoted to management.(15) Oftentimes, Asian
American Christians face similar barriers in the religious realm. In a
2019 Pew Research study, Asian Americans made up 7% of the population in
the United States,(16) but also in 2019, only 4% of multiethnic churches
in the U.S. were led by Asians.(17) Most of the multiethnic churches
with Asian American leadership, with whom I am familiar, are multi-Asian
churches led by Korean and Japanese American pastors. The number of
majority culture and multiethnic churches led by Chinese American
pastors may be below 1%. Assuming that God shows no favoritism (Romans
2:11), God should be gifting pastors from every ethnicity alike with
teaching and leadership gifts. Because of the barriers that Chinese
American pastors seem to encounter in expressing their gifts in majority
culture or multiethnic churches at the highest levels, Chinese heritage
churches are needed. Chinese heritage churches may be one of the few
places where Chinese American pastors are valued as leaders and invited
to be the lead pastors of either a congregation or the entire church.
Chinese heritage churches are a home for these pastors to express their
teaching and leadership gifts at the highest level. They can also serve
as examples of culturally congruent Christian leadership for the next
generations.</p>
<p>Chinese heritage churches also provide a place for many Chinese
American Christians to exercise their spiritual gifts. Most Chinese
heritage churches tend to be small or midsized with a small professional
staff; the needs of the church cannot be satisfied by the professional
staff alone. As a result, it is common for all parishioners to pitch in
and serve the family of believers. It is amazingly beautiful to watch
the ethos of humble service expressed. On any given Sunday, we may have
a doctor involved in the children’s ministry, a lawyer or an engineer
lead worship with a stay-at-home parent, or a college professor teaching
Sunday School. I’ve noticed over the years that many Chinese American
Christians, who leave Chinese heritage churches for large majority
culture dominated churches, tend to cluster with each other at these
churches and frequently do not serve there. However, when they return to
Chinese heritage churches, many start using their spiritual gifts in the
church again. There’s something special about Chinese heritage churches
that empowers Chinese American Christians to exercise their spiritual
gifts.</p>
<p>Whether it is providing space for Chinese American Christians to
pursue Christ in culturally appropriate ways, espousing the values of
Chinese American Christians, encouraging Chinese American Christians to
lead at the highest level, or empowering Chinese American Christians to
serve the church family, Chinese heritage churches provide a spiritual
home for Chinese American Christians. They celebrate the people,
culture, and values that majority culture churches may overlook or may
not see. Likewise, majority culture and multiethnic churches may
celebrate the people, culture, and values that Chinese heritage churches
may overlook or may not see. Both types of churches are needed in God’s
kingdom.</p>
<h2 id="the-future">The Future</h2>
<p>In the 21st century, many English-speaking congregations of Chinese
heritage churches have now grown to include people of other ethnic
groups. In order to increase inclusion, they have experimented with
changing their model of ministry. Many have remained Chinese heritage
churches but have invited non-Chinese Christians to serve on their
pastoral staff or elder council, which signals to everyone in the church
that they are included. Others have tried to rename their English
congregation to a non-Chinese name so that the non-Chinese attendees
feel more included. A few have merged their English congregation with a
majority culture church to create a new multiethnic church. Still others
have planted a new multiethnic church to get a fresh start. There
doesn’t seem to be a clear consensus on the best path forward. The
journey of each Chinese heritage church is unique, based on history, the
demographics of the church, and location. There is excitement in this
journey, and I hope to one day document the journey of various churches
as they experiment with changing their model of ministry.</p>
<p>With many Chinese heritage churches seeking to intentionally shift to
multiethnicity, the question arises, “Will they succeed because there
are already large majority culture led multiethnic churches and
multi-Asian churches in existence?” I believe the answer is, “Yes, but
in a narrower and uniquely Chinese American way.” Each church will
attract a particular group due to its familiarity. Let’s use grocery
stores from Southern California as an analogy. Many large majority
culture led multiethnic churches are kind of like Vons or Safeway
grocery stores, which carry every day American products throughout their
stores and some Chinese products in their international aisles. These
churches attract Chinese Americans who prefer to be in a majority
culture setting. Many multi-Asian churches are like H-Marts, which is a
chain of large Korean supermarkets that focuses on goods from all over
Asia with a limited selection of American products. These churches may
primarily attract Asian Americans, Chinese Americans, and some
non-Asians, who enjoy worshiping God with Asian Americans. Finally,
Chinese heritage churches that start multiethnic ministries are like 99
Ranch, which is a chain of modernized Chinese grocery stores and focuses
on Chinese products but also includes Asian and American staples. These
churches primarily attract Chinese Americans, and some Asian and
non-Asian Americans, who enjoy worshiping God with Chinese Americans.
Each type of church is needed to reach our complex multicultural and
multiethnic country.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>God has and continues to use Chinese heritage churches to fulfill his
missional, intergeneration, educational, multicultural purposes to
provide a home for Chinese American Christians and other Americans. Most
Chinese heritage churches may start off ethnic specific, but they may
broaden over time. Regardless of whether they become ethnically diverse
or not, they are generationally, linguistically, and culturally diverse
and have already made a positive contribution in reaching certain ethnic
minorities, whom majority culture or multiethnic churches may not have
been able to reach. In closing, Ed Stetzer writes, “We must understand
that sometimes ethnic or minority churches do more to further God’s
kingdom than any effort majority culture churches could make to blend
multiple ethnicities into a single church. When we fully comprehend
this, we are freed to do more work that empowers all members of Christ’s
kingdom.”(18)</p>

<p>1 The term “Chinese heritage church” was coined by Enoch Liao, and it
is a church whose history flows out of but is not limited to a Chinese
heritage. This term will be used in this paper and is broader than
“Chinese church.” In addition, although this paper uses specific
examples from Chinese heritage churches in America, many of the
principles may be applicable to ethnic heritage churches in the United
States and other countries.</p>
